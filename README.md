# ARDUINO_PROJECT_Smart_Lock_Using_RFID_and_Password
This project was created to provide an enhanced physical security system on rooms that are in need of high level security. 
The code for the project follows the "AND" logic, thus, the user needs to enter the pin/password and scan the appropriate rfid to properly enter.

ADDITIONAL NOTES:
The original idea was to combine RFID, Keypad, and Fingerprint but due to certain events, the project is limited simply to RFID and Keypad. We strongly encourage that you try to integrate the fingerprint using the "OR" logic, if you want to do this for yourself.
